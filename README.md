# Flus website (flus.fr)

This is the repository of the website [flus.fr](https://flus.fr).

**If you’re looking for the code of [app.flus.fr](https://app.flus.fr), it’s in a
different repository: [flusio/Flus](https://github.com/flusio/Flus).**

flus.fr is the entrance of my paid service based on Flus.
It is intended to French people, thus the website is only translated in French.

## How to contribute?

I sincerely appreciate if you want to contribute.
Here’s a few things you can do:

- taking a subscription at [flus.fr](https://flus.fr) (French);
- reporting bugs or make feature requests [in issues](https://github.com/flusio/flus.fr/issues);
- writing blog posts to speak about the project.

I don’t accept Pull Requests on this project.
A code contribution requires a lot of time to review, to comment and to maintain.
Even the smallest one can require hours of my time.
Also, code isn’t where I need help.

If you have any question, feel free to [send me a message](https://flus.fr/contact).
